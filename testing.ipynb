    "### Intro to Jupyter Notebooks and Basic Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your introduction to Jupyter notebooks and Python programming! This notebook will guide you through the fundamentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are interactive computing environments that allow you to:\n",
    "- Write and execute code in cells\n",
    "- Combine code, text, and visualizations in one document\n",
    "- Share and collaborate on data science projects\n",
    "- Create reproducible research and documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Code Cells**: Execute Python code interactively\n",
    "- **Markdown Cells**: Write formatted text, equations, and documentation\n",
    "- **Output Display**: View results, plots, and data directly below code cells\n",
    "- **Kernel Support**: Run code in various programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Python Concepts We'll Cover:\n",
    "1. **Variables and Data Types**: Storing and manipulating data\n",
    "2. **Print Statements**: Displaying output to the console\n",
    "3. **String Operations**: Working with text data\n",
    "4. **Interactive Execution**: Running code cell by cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some basic Python examples below!"

    "### More Pythonic Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are often more concise and readable ways to write loops, which are referred to as being \"Pythonic\". For printing items from a list, instead of a traditional `for` loop, you can use features like argument unpacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common Pythonic construct is a **list comprehension**, which provides a short syntax for creating a new list based on an existing one. For example: `new_list = [i.upper() for i in welcome_messages]` would create a new list with all messages in uppercase.\n",
